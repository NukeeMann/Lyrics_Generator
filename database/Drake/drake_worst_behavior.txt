motherfucker never loved us
Fucker never loved us
You ain't know, now you know now
Still at it, scrub J's with a toothbrush
Shit, niggas still playing my old shit
But your shit is like the police asking us questions, nigga' we don't know shit
Flex, nigga I'm just flexin'
Nigga never loved us, do it look like we stressin'?
Look at you, look at you, and look at you,
Ah, I'm glad that they chose us
Command, it's a mission trying to fight to the finish just to see 'em all finish
On my worst behavior, no?
They used to never want to hear us (dun know)
Remember? Motherfucker never loved us, remember?
Motherfucker
Remember?
Motherfucker never loved us
I'm on my worst behavior
Don't you ever get it fucked up
Motherfuckers never loved us
Man, motherfuckers never loved us

Hold up, hold my phone
Motherfuckers never loved us
Fucker never loved us
Now you want to roll one
Motherfucker never loved us
So everywhere we go now, full cup
Always hated the boy, but now the boy is the man motherfucker
I done growed up (dun know)
You know me, you know me (dun know)
I'm liable to do anything when it comes to that you owe me (dun know)
You owe me, you owe me
Bitch you better have my money when I come for the shit like O.D.B.

Worst behavior
Who's hot, who not? Tell me who rock, who sell out in stores?
You tell me who flop, who copped the new drop, whose jewels got rocks
Who else making rap albums, doing numbers like it's pop?
Same old pimp, Drake, you know ain't nothin' changed
With these funny style niggas, we done put on in the game
I just ask for some blessings at my grandmother's grave
Then it's back to L.A., open the mail, starin' at the check
Enough to make you throw up, man, it's gross what I net
I'm with my whole set, tennis matches at the crib
I swear I could beat Serena when she playin' with her left
Oh, where I reside it look like a resort inside
Nigga, where your shit from? I imported mine
Bar mitzvah money like my last name Mordecai
Fuck you bitch, I'm more than high
My momma probably hear that and be mortified
This ain't the son you raised who used to take the Acura
5 a.m. then go and shoot Degrassi up on Morningside
For all the stuntin', I'll forever be immortalized
Yeah, back and forth across the borderline
Hate to leave the city, but I've got to do the overtime
Gone all the time, even the important times
I should let you know ahead I'm comin' back on my worst behavior (dun know)
Remember?

Motherfucker

Hold up, hold my phone, they used to never want to hear us (dun know)
Remember?
